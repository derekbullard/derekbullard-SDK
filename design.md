This SDK uses axios to make various get resquests to retrive data from the lord of the rings API (https://the-one-api.dev/documentation).
Once the payload is recived the key vaules are mapped into an array using lodash(4.14.180) .
In the future I would like to add in codables to type check incoming paylaods (https://www.npmjs.com/package/codable)
